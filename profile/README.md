# Welcome

Welcome to our GitHub repositories! Here, you will find a combination of solidity contracts, AWS solutions, and websites that make up the Euler ecosystem.

The solidity contracts are the core of our platform, providing the logic and rules for our decentralized applications.
They are written in the Solidity programming language and deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

The AWS solutions include a range of services and infrastructure that support and enhance the functionality of our decentralized applications.
These solutions are built on top of the AWS platform and provide scalable, reliable, and secure support for our applications.

The websites are the user-facing components of our ecosystem, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with our decentralized applications.
These websites are built using modern web technologies and are designed to provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for our users.

Together, these components make up the Euler ecosystem, providing a powerful and versatile platform for building and using decentralized applications.
We invite you to explore our repositories and learn more about the technologies and solutions that power Euler.
