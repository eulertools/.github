# Dear Euler Tools community,

I'm writing to share some news about our project. After two years of hard work and dedication, I've made the difficult decision to shut down Euler Tools. I've been unable to raise the funding we needed or find a product market fit that would sustain our business in the long term. It's a tough pill to swallow, but I wanted to be transparent with you and let you know what's happening.

I want to take a moment to acknowledge the hard work and commitment of our team. We've poured our hearts and souls into this project, working tirelessly to develop a product that we believed in. We've honored every commitment we made, and we've learned so much along the way. While it's disappointing that we weren't able to achieve our goals, we're proud of what we accomplished and grateful for the opportunity to have pursued this venture.

As I wind down Euler Tools, I want to express my gratitude to our customers, investors, and the project community at large. Your support and encouragement meant the world to me, and we're grateful for the trust you placed in me. While this journey may be coming to an end, I'm excited about the future and the lessons I've learned. I'am eager to apply what I've learned to my next venture, and I'am confident that I'll come out stronger and more resilient as a result.

Thank you for being a part of our journey with Euler Tools. We'll be keeping the site up for a little while longer, so feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback. We're grateful for the experience and look forward to the future.

Sincerely,  
Jorge de los Santos | @tebayoso
